# @babel/types by example

See the website [@babel/types by example](#)

See the official website [@babel/types](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-types)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app to enrich the official documentation.

## Motivation

On the process of learing babel and how to develop babel plugins I've used [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net/) (as I think everybody learing does) and checking back end forth the original babel documentation.

At some point I thought it would be nice to have them both togueder guided by examples.

## Getting Started

I'm using _pnpm_ to build the site and _bun_ to build the main page in _src/app/page.mdx_:

```bash
pnpm run docs # using bun, check script in package.json

pnpm run build
```
